# ZTM-Rust-Activities-Added-Tests
This repository is created from the Rust programming language course available at zerotomastery.io. I decided to add unit tests to most of the basic lectures and didn't include the Clippy. So technically, I am building on top of the lectures and decided to make a separate repository for this.
